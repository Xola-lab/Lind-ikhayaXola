# WELCOME
This a Personal Project I conducted creating a Portfolio Website as an Aspiring Business Analyst/Data Analyst.

### Overview of the Project
There are only two files:
(1) An HTML file (index.html) containing the structure of the portfolio, and
(2) A CSS file (styles-1.css) containing the styling of the site.

The site has a fixed Navigation Bar with the following items:
- "Home", which is self-explanatory, but it is more of a landing page. It contains
two rounded buttons, "View Resume" and "Hire" (which takes you to the "contacts" section
explained below).
- "About", a brief description of myself.
- "Projects", my favourite. This item sends you to my projects section, where I briefly explain
the process in my Data Analysis projects, with a rounded button at the bottom of each project
which will redirect the reader to the specific project on Github.
- "Contact", containing a form the reader can fill to get in touch.

The last two items are direct links to my Github and LinkedIn Profiles.

It would be remiss of me not to mention that this project is still in the workshop. You see, my Web Development skills need a little work.
Follow me on this journey, as I try to develop as a Data Analyst (and, most importantly, as a Programmer in general) and create a better Portfolio
